abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine rates of hospitalization associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among children with and without specific medical conditions.

STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study of all children <3 years old enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program from July 1989 through June 1993 (248,652 child-years).

RESULTS:During the first year of life, the estimated number of RSV hospitalizations per 1000 children was 388 for those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 92 for those with congenital heart disease, 70 for children born at < or = 28 weeks' gestation, 66 for those born at 29 to <33 weeks, 57 for those born at 33 to <36 weeks, and 30 for children born at term with no underlying medical condition. In the second year of life, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had an estimated 73 RSV hospitalizations per 1000 children, whereas those with congenital heart disease had 18 and those with prematurity 16 per 1000. Overall, 53% of RSV hospitalizations occurred in healthy children born at term.

CONCLUSIONS:Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have high rates of RSV hospitalization until 24 months of age. In contrast, after the first year of life, children with congenital heart disease or prematurity have rates no higher than that of children at low risk who are <12 months old.},

abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of palivizumab (pal-vizh-m{\"a}b), an intramuscularly administered monoclonal antibody preparation. Recommendations for its use are based on a large, randomized study demonstrating a 55% reduction in the risk of hospitalization attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk pediatric patients. Infants and children with chronic lung disease (CLD), formerly designated bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as prematurely born infants without CLD experienced a reduced number of hospitalizations while receiving palivizumab compared with a placebo. Both palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) are available for protecting high-risk children against serious complications from RSV infections. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk children because of ease of administration (intramuscular), lack of interference with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine, and lack of complications associated with intravenous administration of human immune globulin products. RSV-IGIV, however, provides additional protection against other respiratory viral illnesses and may be preferred for selected high-risk children including those receiving replacement intravenous immune globulin because of underlying immune deficiency or human immuno-deficiency virus infection. For premature infants about to be discharged from hospitals during the RSV season, physicians could consider administering RSV-IGIV for the first month of prophylaxis. Most of the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the selection of infants and children to receive RSV-prophylaxis remain unchanged. Palivizumab has been shown to provide benefit for infants who were 32 to 35 weeks of gestation at birth. RSV-IGIV is contraindicated and palivizumab is not recommended for children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The number of patients with adverse events judged to be related to palivizumab was similar to that of the placebo group (11% vs 10%, respectively); discontinuation of injections for adverse events related to palivizumab was rare.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections with palivizumab based on actual cost and observed incidence rates in various pediatric risk groups.

DESIGN:Decision tree analysis comparing children with various combinations of the following indications: chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or prematurity ($\le$32 weeks gestation), and children with none of these indications. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify parameter uncertainty.

SETTING:Florida during the 2004-2005 RSV season.

PARTICIPANTS:A total of 159,790 Medicaid-eligible children aged 0 to 2 years.

INTERVENTION:Palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis.

OUTCOMES MEASURE:Incremental cost (2010 US dollars) per hospitalization for RSV infection avoided.

RESULTS:The mean cost of palivizumab per dose ranged from $1661 for infants younger than 6 months of age to $2584 for children in their second year of life. Among preterm infants younger than 6 months of age without other indications, immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab cost $302,103 (95% confidence interval, $141,850-$914,798) to prevent 1 RSV-related hospitalization. Given a mean cost of $8910 for 1 RSV-related hospitalization in this subgroup, palivizumab would be cost-neutral at a per-dose cost of $47. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the other subgroups ranged from $361,727 to more than $1.3 million per RSV-related hospitalization avoided in children up to 2 years of age with chronic lung disease and no additional risk factors. Younger age and multiple indications were associated with improvements in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

CONCLUSIONS:The cost of immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab far exceeded the economic benefit of preventing hospitalizations, even in infants at highest risk for RSV infection.},

During the 1996 to 1997 RSV season, 1502 children with prematurity ($\le$35 weeks) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were randomized to receive 5 injections of either palivizumab (15 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo by intramuscular injection every 30 days. The primary endpoint was hospitalization with confirmed RSV infection. Children were followed for 150 days (30 days from the last injection). Those with hospitalization as a result of RSV infection were evaluated for total number of days in the hospital, total days with increased supplemental oxygen, total days with moderate or severe lower respiratory tract illness, and incidence and total days of intensive care and mechanical ventilation. The incidence of hospitalization for respiratory illness not caused by RSV and the incidence of otitis media were also evaluated. The placebo and palivizumab groups were balanced at entry for demographics and RSV risk factors. Ninety-nine percent of children in both groups completed the protocol and ∼93% received all five scheduled injections.</p><h3>Results.</h3> <p>Palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in a 55% reduction in hospitalization as a result of RSV (10.6% placebo vs 4.8% palivizumab). Children with prematurity but without BPD had a 78% reduction in RSV hospitalization (8.1% vs 1.8%); children with BPD had a 39% reduction (12.8% vs 7.9%). When gender, entry age, entry weight, BPD, and gestational age were included in a logistic regression model, the effect of prophylaxis with palivizumab remained statistically significant. The palivizumab group had proportionally fewer total RSV hospital days, fewer RSV hospital days with increased oxygen, fewer RSV hospital days with a moderate/severe lower respiratory tract illness, and a lower incidence of intensive care unit admission. Palivizumab was safe and well tolerated. No significant differences were observed in reported adverse events between the two groups. Few children discontinued injections for related adverse events (0.3%). Reactions at the site of injection were uncommon (1.8% placebo vs 2.7% palivizumab); the most frequent reaction was mild and transient erythema. Mild or moderate elevations of aspartate aminotransferase occurred in 1.6% of placebo recipients and 3.6% of palivizumab recipients; for alanine aminotransferase these percentages were 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively. Hepatic and renal adverse events related to the study drug were similar in the two groups.</p><h3>Conclusions.</h3> <p>Monthly intramuscular administration of palivizumab is safe and effective for prevention of serious RSV illness in premature children and those with BPD.</p>},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The primary role of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in causing infant hospitalizations is well recognized, but the total burden of RSV infection among young children remains poorly defined.

METHODS:We conducted prospective, population-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections among children under 5 years of age in three U.S. counties. We enrolled hospitalized children from 2000 through 2004 and children presenting as outpatients in emergency departments and pediatric offices from 2002 through 2004. RSV was detected by culture and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Clinical information was obtained from parents and medical records. We calculated population-based rates of hospitalization associated with RSV infection and estimated the rates of RSV-associated outpatient visits.

RESULTS:Among 5067 children enrolled in the study, 919 (18%) had RSV infections. Overall, RSV was associated with 20% of hospitalizations, 18% of emergency department visits, and 15% of office visits for acute respiratory infections from November through April. Average annual hospitalization rates were 17 per 1000 children under 6 months of age and 3 per 1000 children under 5 years of age. Most of the children had no coexisting illnesses. Only prematurity and a young age were independent risk factors for hospitalization. Estimated rates of RSV-associated office visits among children under 5 years of age were three times those in emergency departments. Outpatients had moderately severe RSV-associated illness, but few of the illnesses (3%) were diagnosed as being caused by RSV.

CONCLUSIONS:RSV infection is associated with substantial morbidity in U.S. children in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Most children with RSV infection were previously healthy, suggesting that control strategies targeting only high-risk children will have a limited effect on the total disease burden of RSV infection.},

abstract = {Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first published in a policy statement in 1998. Guidance initially was based on the result from a single randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 1996-1997 describing an overall reduction in RSV hospitalization rate from 10.6% among placebo recipients to 4.8% among children who received prophylaxis. The results of a second randomized, placebo-controlled trial of children with hemodynamically significant heart disease were published in 2003 and revealed a reduction in RSV hospitalization rate from 9.7% in control subjects to 5.3% among prophylaxis recipients. Because no additional controlled trials regarding efficacy were published, AAP guidance has been updated periodically to reflect the most recent literature regarding children at greatest risk of severe disease. Since the last update in 2012, new data have become available regarding the seasonality of RSV circulation, palivizumab pharmacokinetics, the changing incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalizations, the effects of gestational age and other risk factors on RSV hospitalization rates, the mortality of children hospitalized with RSV infection, and the effect of prophylaxis on wheezing and palivizumab-resistant RSV isolates. These data enable further refinement of AAP guidance to most clearly focus on those children at greatest risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of palivizumab in children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD).

STUDY DESIGN:A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 1287 children with CHD randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 5 monthly intramuscular injections of 15 mg/kg palivizumab or placebo. Children were followed for 150 days. The primary efficacy end point was antigen-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization.

RESULTS:Palivizumab recipients had a 45% relative reduction in RSV hospitalizations (P=.003), a 56% reduction in total days of RSV hospitalization per 100 children (P=.003), and a 73% reduction in total RSV hospital days with increased supplemental oxygen per 100 children (P=.014). Adverse events were similar in the treatment groups; no child had drug discontinued for a related adverse event. Serious adverse events occurred in 55.4% of palivizumab recipients and 63.1% of placebo recipients (P<.005); none were related to palivizumab. Twenty-one children (3.3%) in the palivizumab group and 27 (4.2%) in the placebo group died; no deaths were attributed to palivizumab. The rates of cardiac surgeries performed earlier than planned were similar in the treatment groups.

CONCLUSIONS:Monthly palivizumab (15 mg/kg IM) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective for prophylaxis of serious RSV disease in young children with hemodynamically significant CHD.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory infections among infants and young children worldwide. During 1997-2006, an estimated 132,000-172,000 children aged <5 years were hospitalized for RSV infection annually in the United States. In temperate climate zones, RSV generally circulates during the fall, winter, and spring, but the exact timing and duration of RSV seasons vary by region and year. To determine seasonal trends in the circulation of RSV at national and regional levels, data collected by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) were analyzed. For 2011-12, the RSV season onset ranged from late October to mid-January and season offset ranged from early March to early May in all 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions, excluding Florida. Florida is reported separately because it has an earlier season onset and longer duration than the rest of the country. For data reported as of January 7, 2013, RSV onset for the 2012-13 season occurred in all but one of the HHS regions by December 15, 2012. Seasonal patterns remained consistent with previous years and demonstrated the usual differences in RSV circulation among HHS regions. Health-care providers and public health officials can use information on RSV circulation to guide diagnostic testing and timing of RSV immunoprophylaxis for children at high risk for severe respiratory infection.},

This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based. On the basis of results of a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Because of the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and because of the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if 2 or more risk factors are present.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes seasonal epidemics between December and March (April) and remains the main agent that causes severe lower respiratory tract infections in young infants. Children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia up to 24 months of age and preterm infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks and below, who are less than six months of age, are at highest risk for severe RSV infection. RSV-IGIV has been demonstrated to reduce significantly RSV associated hospitalizations, RSV associated hospital days and the incidence of severe RSV lower respiratory tract infections. Monthly infusions during RSV season were safe and well tolerated. Adverse events related to the hyperimmune globulin infusion were generally mild (< 3%) including fluid overload, decreased oxygen saturation and fever. Palivizumab, an intramuscularly administered humanized monoclonal antibody (RSV-glycoprotein-F antibody), will be preferable for the future because of ease of administration and comparable reduction in the risk of hospitalization. RSV-IGIV and palivizumab are both cost expansive and prophylaxis should be limited to high-risk infants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Age-specific comparisons of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates can inform prevention efforts, including vaccine development plans. Previous US studies have not estimated jointly the burden of these viruses using similar data sources and over many seasons.

METHODS:We estimated influenza and RSV hospitalizations in 5 age categories (<1, 1-4, 5-49, 50-64, and $\ge$65 years) with data for 13 states from 1993-1994 through 2007-2008. For each state and age group, we estimated the contribution of influenza and RSV to hospitalizations for respiratory and circulatory disease by using negative binomial regression models that incorporated weekly influenza and RSV surveillance data as covariates.

RESULTS:Mean rates of influenza and RSV hospitalizations were 63.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.5-237) and 55.3 (95% CI, 44.4-107) per 100000 person-years, respectively. The highest hospitalization rates for influenza were among persons aged $\ge$65 years (309/100000; 95% CI, 186-1100) and those aged <1 year (151/100000; 95% CI, 151-660). For RSV, children aged <1 year had the highest hospitalization rate (2350/100000; 95% CI, 2220-2520) followed by those aged 1-4 years (178/100000; 95% CI, 155-230). Age-standardized annual rates per 100000 person-years varied substantially for influenza (33-100) but less for RSV (42-77).

CONCLUSIONS:Overall US hospitalization rates for influenza and RSV are similar; however, their age-specific burdens differ dramatically. Our estimates are consistent with those from previous studies focusing either on influenza or RSV. Our approach provides robust national comparisons of hospitalizations associated with these 2 viral respiratory pathogens by age group and over time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important viral pathogens causing acute respiratory infections in children. It results in about 3.4 million hospitalisations annually in children under five. Palivizumab is an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, administered intramuscularly at a dose of 15 mg/kg once every 30 days. The efficacy and safety of palivizumab has been evaluated in multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and a large number of economic evaluations (EEs) have tested its cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES:To assess the effectiveness and safety of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with placebo, or another type of prophylaxis, in reducing the risk of complications (hospitalisation due to RSV infection) in high-risk infants and children. To assess the cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants and children in different risk groups.

SEARCH METHODS:We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1996 to August 2012), CINAHL (1996 to August 2012) and LILACS (1996 to August 2012) for studies of effectiveness and safety. We searched the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED 2012, Issue 4), Health Economics Evaluations Database (HEED, 9 August 2012) and Paediatric Economic Database Evaluations (PEDE, 1980 to 2009), MEDLINE (1996 to July week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (1996 to August 2012) for economic evaluations.

SELECTION CRITERIA:We included RCTs comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with a placebo, no prophylaxis or another type of prophylaxis in preventing serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in paediatric patients at high risk. We included cost-effectiveness analyses and cost-utility analyses comparing palivizumab prophylaxis with no prophylaxis.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data for both the RCTs and EEs. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and for adverse events (AEs). We provided a narrative summary of results for continuous outcomes, due to missing data on standard deviations. We performed fixed-effect meta-analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no indication of heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarised the results reported in included EEs, such as incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility ratios (ICERs), and we calculated ICER present values in 2011 Euros for all studies.

MAIN RESULTS:Of the seven available RCTs, three compared palivizumab with a placebo in a total of 2831 patients, and four compared palivizumab with motavizumab in a total of 8265 patients. All RCTs were sponsored by the drug manufacturing company. The overall quality of RCTs was good, but for most of the outcomes assessed only data from two studies contributed to the analysis. Palivizumab prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in RSV hospitalisations (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64) when compared to placebo. When compared to motavizumab, palivizumab recipients showed a non-significant increase in the risk of RSV hospitalisations (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.90). In both cases, the proportion of children with any AE or any AE related to the study drug was similar between the two groups.In terms of economic evidence, we included 34 studies that reported cost-effectiveness and/or cost-utility data for palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis, in high-risk children with different underlying medical conditions. The overall quality of EEs was good, but the variations in modelling approaches were considerable across the studies, leading to big differences in cost-effectiveness results. The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis depends on the consumption of resources taken into account by the study authors; and on the cost-effectiveness threshold set by the healthcare sector in each country.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is evidence that palivizumab prophylaxis is effective in reducing the frequency of hospitalisations due to RSV infection, i.e. in reducing the incidence of serious lower respiratory tract RSV disease in children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease or those born preterm.Results from economic evaluations of palivizumab prophylaxis are inconsistent, implying that economic findings must be interpreted with caution. ICER values varied considerably across studies, from highly cost-effective to not cost-effective. The availability of low-cost palivizumab would reduce its inequitable distribution, so that RSV prophylaxis would be available to the poorest countries where children are at greatest risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of hospitalization among infants. However, estimates of the RSV hospitalization burden have varied, and precision has been limited by the use of age strata grouped in blocks of 6 to $\ge$ 12 months.

METHODS:We analyzed data from a 5-year, prospective, population-based surveillance for young children who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI) during October through March 2000-2005. The total population at risk was stratified by month of age by birth certificate information to yield hospitalization rates.

RESULTS:There were 559 (26%) RSV-infected children among the 2149 enrolled children hospitalized with ARI (85% of all eligible children with ARI). The average RSV hospitalization rate was 5.2 per 1000 children <24 months old. The highest age-specific rate was in infants 1 month old (25.9 per 1000 children). Infants $\le$ 2 months of age, who comprised 44% of RSV-hospitalized children, had a hospitalization rate of 17.9 per 1000 children. Most children (79%) were previously healthy. Very preterm infants (<30 weeks' gestation) accounted for only 3% of RSV cases but had RSV hospitalization rates 3 times that of term infants.

CONCLUSIONS:Young infants, especially those who were 1 month old, were at greatest risk of RSV hospitalization. Four-fifths of RSV-hospitalized infants were previously healthy. To substantially reduce the burden of RSV hospitalizations, effective general preventive strategies will be required for all young infants, not just those with risk factors.},

This statement provides revised recommendations for administering RSV prophylaxis to infants and children with congenital heart disease, for identifying infants with a history of preterm birth and chronic lung disease who are most likely to benefit from immunoprophylaxis, and for reducing the risk of RSV exposure and infection in high-risk children. On the basis of results of a recently completed clinical trial, prophylaxis with palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Because of the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and because of the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if 2 or more risk factors are present. High-risk infants should not attend child care during the RSV season when feasible, and exposure to tobacco smoke should be eliminated.},

In the United States, RSV season begins in the fall, peaks in winter, and ends in the late winter and early spring. However, the exact timing and duration vary from year to year and by geographic region. To describe trends in RSV seasonality, data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) were used to determine the onset, offset, and peak of the July 2010--June 2011 RSV season, and for an aggregate analysis of the four most recent RSV seasons (July 2007--June 2011). During 2010--11, excluding Florida, season onset occurred from mid-November to early January, and offset occurred from mid-March to late April across all 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. Florida is reported separately because it has an earlier onset and longer duration than the rest of the country. During the four seasons from 2007 through 2011, onset among the HHS regions excluding Florida ranged from mid-October to early January, and offset ranged from early February to early May. Information on national and regional patterns can be used by clinicians and public health officials to guide diagnostic testing during respiratory disease outbreaks and determine when to provide RSV immunoprophylaxis for children at high risk for serious complications.},
